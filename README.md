# AI Agent for Backend System Operation Using Natural Language

## Project Overview
This project introduces an AI agent that enables users to interact with a backend system using natural language. By bridging the gap between human communication and database manipulation, it simplifies backend operations for non-technical users, allowing them to perform database tasks such as **insert**, **update**, and **delete** through an intuitive web-based interface.

---

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  - Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 model for interpreting user inputs.
  - Translates natural language queries into structured commands for backend operations.
  - Supports synonyms and diverse phrasing for improved flexibility and usability.

- **Backend Key-Value Store:**
  - Built with **Supabase** for a dynamic database structure.
  - Supports core functionalities: `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
  - Tracks changes with a timestamp-based audit trail.

- **User Interface:**
  - A responsive web-based interface for seamless interaction.
  - Displays database state and provides real-time feedback on operations.

- **Integration Layer:**
  - Manages communication between user inputs, LLM processing, and database execution.
  - Ensures accurate interpretation of user intentions.

## Implementation Highlights

- Designed prompts for ChatGPT-4 to process natural language queries accurately.
- Used Supabase for a robust key-value store with timestamp tracking.
- Developed a responsive React-based web interface for real-time interaction.
- Validated the system with extensive testing for reliability and accuracy.
